							<h3>Types of Personal Loan</h3>
							<p>There are two types of personal loan schemes. They are:</p>

							<p>
								<strong>Unsecured Personal Loan: </strong>Under these types of
								personal loan schemes, you donâ€™t need to provide any security or
								collateral to the bank. If you meet all the eligibility criteria
								and have a decent credit score, then you can avail yourself of
								an unsecured personal loan.
							<p>
								<strong>Secured Personal Loan: </strong> Under these types of
								personal loan schemes, you will need to provide some form of
								security or collateral to the bank. A business loan or a gold
								loan is an example of a secured loan as you may have to provide
								some form of property to apply for a business loan and gold if
								you wish to avail a gold loan.
							</p> <br />
							<h3>Top Personal Loan Schemes and Offers</h3>
							<p>You can either visit the official website of the bank to
								directly apply for a personal loan or visit the BankBazaar.com
								website to compare different loans and then apply for one which
								suits you best.</p>
							<h3>Personal Loan Interest Rates</h3>
							<p>The personal loan interest rates vary between 10.15% p.a.
								and 36% p.a. Depending on the loan amount availed by you, your
								credit score, and repayment tenure, the interest rate charged on
								your loan is decided. If you maintain a high credit score and
								have a good relationship with the bank, then the interest rate
								on your personal loan can be lowered.</p>

							<h3>Uses of Personal Loan</h3>
							<p>What can you use a personal loan for? Since it is an
								unsecured loan without the need for any collateral, there are
								very few limitations on how you can use a personal loan. It can
								broadly be used for consolidating your debt (from other loans or
								credit cards), making high-value purchases for which you do not
								have cash in hand, or for emergency situations. It cannot be
								used for speculative purposes or for making investments in the
								stock market. Some of the common reasons that people take out
								personal loans for includes meeting sudden business or
								educational expenses, paying for a vacation, buying high-end
								electronic gadgets or household appliances, wedding expenses,
								emergency medical expenses, home renovations, etc. It can also
								be used for buying a vehicle if the rate of interest on the
								personal loan is lower than that of a vehicle loan. Thus, a
								personal loan has a wide variety of uses and can come in handy
								for meeting either planned or emergency expenditure.</p>
							<h3>Personal Loan Eligibility Criteria</h3>
							<p>The following factors are taken into consideration when a
								lender goes through your loan application. If you meet these
								criteria, you are eligible for a personal loan:</p>
